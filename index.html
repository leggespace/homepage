Working for startups, non-profit organizations, small established businesses as well as larger enterprises has taught me the valuable lesson of adapting a solution to the size of the client as well as the existing infrastructure. A small established business might only need a node running on a hosted server while an enterprise might instead require an globally scalable multi-continent deployment to keep up with business needs. All project comes with their limitations, which do not have to be seen as restrictions but instead possibilities to engineer the best possible solution for each buissness need. </p> <div class="social"> <ul class="social-buttons"> <li><a href="https://github.com/rikardlegge/" class="social-btn"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a></li> <li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rikardlegge/" class="social-btn"><i class="fa fa-linkedin"></i></a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <section class="contact-wrap section-padding text-center" id="contact"> <div class="container"> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-12"> <h1 class="arrow">Get in touch</h1> </div> </div> <div class="contact-details row"> <div class="col-xs-4"> <div class="light-box"> <h2><i class="fa fa-map-marker"></i><span>Address</span></h2> <p><a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gothenburg">Gothenburg, Sweden</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-4"> <div class="light-box"> <h2><i class="fa fa-mobile"></i><span>Phone</span></h2> <p><a href="tel:+46702005536">(+46)70-200 5536</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="col-xs-4"> <div class="light-box"> <h2><i class="fa fa-paper-plane"></i><span>Email</span></h2> <p><a href="mailto:rikard@leggespace.com">rikard@leggespace.com</a></p> </div> </div> </div> </div> </section> <script>function e(e,t,o){n(e,function(e){e.classList.add("animated"),e.classList.remove("waypoint-hidden"),e.classList.add(t)},{threshold:[o]})}function n(e,n,t){var o=document.querySelector(e);new IntersectionObserver(function(e,t){e.forEach(function(e){e.intersectionRatio>0&&n(o)})},t).observe(o)}"undefined"!=typeof IntersectionObserver&&(document.querySelectorAll(".waypoint").forEach(function(e){return e.classList.add("waypoint-hidden")}),e("#waypoint-1","fadeInLeft",0),e("#waypoint-2","fadeInLeft",.4),e("#waypoint-3","fadeInLeft",.4),e("#waypoint-4","fadeInLeft",.4),e("#waypoint-5","fadeInLeft",.4));</script> </body></html>
